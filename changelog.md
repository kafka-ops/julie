  by default this filters all topics starting with underscore. Users can configure more than one filter in the property file.
* Made internal topics for Kafka Connect, Schema Registry and Confluent Control Center configurable.
  By introducing this, users can now handle non-standard instances of Schema Registry or having for example more than
  a single Kafka Connect cluster (situation more than common).
* Add a rest api component, available under server-api and created using the Micronaut Framework. This component is an independent artifact, that wrap the
  Kafka Topology Builder library in a single and uniform web application that can be used to automate and centralise the configuration management for clusters.
* Remove the requirement of writing in the configuration file the access control method, as of now will be ACLs as default value and if other (like RBAC) is required
  it will have to be properly configured.

* Rename team as context as it was a confusing wording. This solve issue #68.
* Fix bug on removal of acls. This solve issue #72.
* Fix bug with schema registration and file path reference,  now by default all are relative to the main directory where the topology file is staying.
* Improved delete and general management of acls logic, only create what is necessary, only delete what is mandatory.
* Fixed a problem with the schema registry client that got no configs, so it would not be possible to use with security contrain systems such as confluent cloud.
* Add the possibility to define a topic and project pattern using the jinja format, like this users can tune the order of the variables without hampeting the full idea of the structure
* Add a framework to add incoming validation for topology files, this could be configured with the topology.validations config array.
* Added the lightbend config library to support a more structured config management, including usage of environment variables and multiple config formats.
* Made the broker CLI param optional, however one of both config or CLI has to be present, CLI takes always precedence over the config value.

v1.0.0-rc1:
* Add support for platform wide acls for control center in teh topology description file.
* Port support for schema registry and confluent control center roles in the rbac provider. Now the two providers are future pair.
* Fix the usage of the source field, it should not be mandatory as the others list and the custom topology serdes can cover a dynamic list
  of fields between the team and the first project separator.
* Add code to support passing a directory, only topologies for a single team are supported for now.
* Add support for passing a directory, instead of a single file as topology. If a directory is passed, all topologies are expected to be from
  the same team and all subsequent projects will be at append one after the other.
* Implement the necessary methods to pass back the status from the rbac modules, so the reply and clean up is possible with multiple runs
* Added an option to use redis as external system to keep the acls status list. Now people can use either files or redis.
  Note in the future this subsystem should be externalised as plugins
* raise up error handling in case of non available cluster
* Make usage of the maven jdeb plugin to build a deb package to use in distributions such as Debian and relative like the Ubuntu family
* Fix parser problem with non required parameters, such as the ones for the acls where an empty array had to be in place, now all principals for acls if not required can be ignored and will have no effect
* Ammend param and typo issues with rbac that where not facilitating the execution flow, updated as well the examples to match a correct execution flow

v0.11:
* Add support for platform wide acls for schema registry in the topology description file.
* Rebird the option to disable deletes when not required anymore.

* add release mechanism for docker images with the kafka topology builder (#21)
* Add version number to maven-compiler-plugin (#16)
* Add support to keeping notes of generated acls (#15)
* Add support for storing the current generated acls within a state file. This is useful to delete
  acls that are known and generated previously by the topology builder.

v0.10.3:
* updated ACLs for producers and consumers to include the describe permission in order to properly
  allow for metadata recollection.
* Fix wrong verification for parameters in the CLI.

* Introduced an option to select with Access Control mechanism is used using the application configuration file.
* Add initial rbac support for application roles.
* Add the option to define custom rbac (per project) roles. This option allows you to define inside the project level role and principals mapping such as ResourceOwner, ... this will be automatically applied per topic if using the rbac acces control provider

v0.9:
* RPM package for installation in Redhat based systems.
* Fully descriptive managed ACLs (via a descriptor file) - Create, Read, Update and Delete.
* Fully descriptive and structured topic management (via a descriptor file) - Create, Read, Update and Delete.
