If you have landed in this page is because you aim to get started with the Kafka Topology Builder.
To get you started we recommend:

* Want a quickstart ? checkout our demo in https://github.com/purbon/kafka-topology-builder-demo.
* New to gitops and kafka, check the :doc:`core-concepts` page.
* If you are ready to jump in, start with the :doc:`workflow-setup`.

Installation
-----------

To install the Kafka Topology Builder and enable your teams to use a gitops approach when managing Apache Kafka you need:

* A CI/CD server, for example Jenkins, but any other will serve the purpose
* A git repository where the Topology description will be stored
* And for sure a Kafka cluster :-)

See the  :doc:`workflow-setup` section to learn more how to setup the required components to enable the full workflow.

if you already have this components, you can install the topology builder agent:

* As an RPM package. You can self build this package from the git repository or get the latest version from the release page.
* As a docker image, available from `docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/purbon/kafka-topology-builder>`_.
