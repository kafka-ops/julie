To learn more about JulieOps listen to `this podcast <https://developer.confluent.io/podcast/automating-devops-for-apache-kafka-and-confluent-ft-pere-urbon-bayes>`_ with Pere Urb√≥n-Bayes.

Installation
-----------

To install JulieOps and enable your teams to use a gitops approach when managing Apache Kafka you need:

* A CI/CD server, for example Jenkins, but any other will serve the purpose
* A git repository where the Topology description will be stored
* And for sure a Kafka cluster :-)

See the  :doc:`workflow-setup` section to learn more how to setup the required components to enable the full workflow.

if you already have this components, you can install the JulieOps agent:

* As an RPM package for RedHat/CentOS linux distributions.
* As a DEB package for Debian based OS.
* As tar.gz source package.
* As well in the form of a docker image, available from `docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/purbon/kafka-topology-builder>`_.

You always can self build this package, all information is available from `here <https://github.com/kafka-ops/julie/blob/master/RELEASE.md>`_.
Users can download the latest "official" release artefacts directly from the download page `here <https://github.com/kafka-ops/julie/releases>`_.
